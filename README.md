# About me

[I'm Thu Vo, a Web Developer.](https://vctqs1.herokuapp.com/)

I have several years of experience working. I already approach many languages (NodeJS, Golang, ... ).

But for now, I want to focus my passion on developing products with React.

Besides, I also learned more about Deployment, CI/CD, Testing and Automation
